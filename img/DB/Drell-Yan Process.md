-  electron positron output process
$$  
\frac{d\sigma}{dm^2} = \int dx_1 dx_2 \, f_q(x_1, \mu) f_{\bar{q}}(x_2, \mu) \frac{d\hat{\sigma}}{dm^2} (q\bar{q} \to e^+ e^-) $$ by measuring electron positron invariant mass , it can make peak with Z boson (x = momentum of quark and anti quark patrons in protons )  - this is a first leading order 

 $$f_q(x_i, \mu)$$
 is a distribution function of quark .




- In [[S channel]]
Can use luminosity function due to following relationship
 $$\hat{s}=(p_{1}+p_{2})^2 = p_{1}^2 + p_{2}^2 +2p_{1}\cdot p_{2}= x_{1}x_{2}S 
$$
> **solution of this text**:
> each p1 and p2 has small mass ,
> $$ \hat{s}= 2p_{1}\cdot p_{2}$$
> and also , all of the Energy S has relationship of ,
> $$ \hat{S}= (P_{1}+P_{2})^2 = 2\cdot P_{1}\cdot P_{2} $$
>  which can be written as 
>$$\hat{s}= x_{1}x_{2}S$$







by this relation ship, Luminosity function define as , 

$$L_{\bar{q}q}(\hat{s})= \int dx_{1}dx_{2}f(x_{1},\mu)f(x_{2},\mu)δ(x_{1}x_{2}S-\hat{s})$$

which makes cross section by using Lumniosity

 $$L_{\bar{q}q}(\hat{s})= \int dx_{1}dx_{2}f(x_{1},\mu)f(x_{2},\mu)δ(x_{1}x_{2}S-\hat{s})$$
